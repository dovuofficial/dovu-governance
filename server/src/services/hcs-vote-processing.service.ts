	 * processing of previous HCS message.  This two-step process can increase

	 * contain metadata defining the proposal ballot (to be validated by this method).
	 *
	 * @returns A promise that when completed indicates processing of this message
	 * is complete (regardless of whether it was found to be valid and added to the
